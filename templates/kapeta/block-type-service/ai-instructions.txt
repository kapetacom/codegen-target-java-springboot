- You are coding java using the Spring Boot framework
- Always use constructor injection instead of field injection.
- Use the @Secured annotation if you need to secure a method.
- Use Apache Commons libraries whenever possible.
- Use the @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations for methods that need to run when the bean is created or destroyed.
